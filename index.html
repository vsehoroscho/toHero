      <p class="text"><strong>T</strong>he following is the original piece I wrote for CNN last year about location independent entrepreneurs, also known as “digital nomads.” Since the whole “Work Online, Travel the World and Live the Dream” angle had been done to death in a million places, I decided to go the other direction and show the dark side of being a digital nomad — the challenges one faces, the emotional pitfalls, the social sacrifices.
<br><br>
Predictably, CNN hated it. The editors hacked it to pieces and asked me to rewrite sections to make it less gloomy.But I was always fond of the original, so I’m posting it here unabridged.</p>
